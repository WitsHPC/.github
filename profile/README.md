Hey there, we are the HPC Interest group at the [University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg](wits.ac.za/), South Africa.

## 🔥 What We Do
We give regular talks and practical sessions about various topics in HPC, such as:
- How to use Bash
- How to compile software from source
- How to use tools such as `vim` and `make`
- How to do parallel programming

We also select and train the Wits student cluster competition teams.

We've also started with hackathons and hope to have many more competitions - with prizes! - in the future.

## 🤝 Who We Are
We are engineering and computer science undergraduate/postgraduate students at the University of the Witwatersrand

## 🤝 Get Involved
If you want to come attend the talks, they are usually Wednesdays 13:15 - 14:15 in the MSL labs on West Campus, anyone can attend and we generally assume no prior knowledge.


If you want to come give a talk, or if you'd like technical HPC support for your research, please do reach out!
